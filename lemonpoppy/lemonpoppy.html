    <ul>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <p>make the cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the buttery spread, sugar, applesauce, and lemon juice on medium speed until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the gluten free flour blend and lemon zest, mix to combine. Add the poppy seeds and mix. (If the dough seems too wet, add a bit more flour. Texture can vary with different gluten free flour blends).
        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two parts, and shape into discs. Wrap the discs with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours, or freeze for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly flour a rolling pin and rolling surface with gluten free flour. Place the dough on the surface and roll to about a ¼ inch thickness. (If the dough is too cold and stiff, you may have to let it warm up just a little bit before rolling.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 350 for 12a-14 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Make the glaze:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the confectioner's sugar into a mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice, or water, depending on if you want a lemony glaze, or just a sugary glaze, and whisk. If the glaze is too thick, add more liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle glaze over cooled cookies.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>*note: you can use regular all-purpose flour or white spelt flour if you don't need these to be gluten free.
